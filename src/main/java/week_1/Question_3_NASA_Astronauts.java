/**
 To become a NASA astronaut, you need to be between 58 and 76 inches tall, so you
 are not too tall to fit in the spaceship, but are tall enough to reach all the controls.

 You also need to be able to swim at least 75 yards, in case you make a water landing on your return to earth.

 This program asks the user questions about their height and swimming ability.
 It calls a method to check if the user meets NASA's requirements.
 Finish the checkAstronautQualifications method by writing conditional statements
 to determine if the user has potential as a NASA astronaut. The method will return true or false.

 There are many ways of doing this too - once you've written and tested a solution,
 can you think of another way of doing it? Make sure your tests still pass.
